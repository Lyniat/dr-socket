# DragonRuby Socket Extension

# How-To
You need [DragonRuby](https://dragonruby.org/toolkit/game) *Indie* or *Pro* to be able to use *C Extensions* and this library.
CMake should handle all the stuff so after successfully building you should be able to start this app just like any other DR app.

Additionally required for building:
- CMake (>= 3.22)
- git

## Windows
- [MingW](https://winlibs.com) (tested on *GCC 13.1.0 (with POSIX threads) + LLVM/Clang/LLD/LLDB 16.0.5 + MinGW-w64 11.0.0 (UCRT) - release 5*)

## macOS
clang should be able to compile this out of the box.

## Linux
Tested with clang but gcc might also work.

## Other
Support for *Android* and *iOS* is WIP.

# About
Currently only proof-of-concept but I plan to make this a useful thing ðŸ˜‰
